# 🛒 OpenCart QA Automation Project

This is a comprehensive end-to-end QA Automation project developed using Python to test OpenCart's e-commerce platform. It includes UI tests, API testing, and BDD with Gherkin syntax — built for scalability, clarity, and real-world CI/CD readiness.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates how a QA Automation Engineer would work in an Agile team, covering:

- ✅ Manual test planning and strategy
- ✅ Selenium-based UI automation
- ✅ REST API testing with `requests` and `Postman`
- ✅ Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with `Behave`
- ✅ Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability
- ✅ Integration with a MySQL database for dynamic test data
- ✅ Logging, assertions, and clean structure following SRP & DRY principles

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/caioaza/opencart-qa-automation.git
   cd opencart-qa-automation
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up MySQL with XAMPP**:
   - Start Apache & MySQL via XAMPP Control Panel
   - Create the necessary DB and table(s) for test data
   - Update `properties.ini` with your credentials.

## Running Tests

### Run All UI Tests (Pytest)

```bash
pytest OpenCartDemoSimulation/tests/
```

### Run Only One Specific Test

```bash
pytest OpenCartDemoSimulation/tests/test_cart.py::TestCart::test_1_verify_items_data
```

---

## API Testing

### Run API Tests via Pytest

```bash
pytest OpenCartDemoSimulation/tests/test_cart_api.py
```

### API Test Using DB-Driven Payload

- Pulls product IDs from local MySQL to build dynamic payload
- Sends POST requests to the OpenCart Bulk Cart API

---

## BDD Testing with Behave

### Run All Scenarios

```bash
behave OpenCartDemoSimulation/features/
```

### Tag Specific Scenarios (UI or API)

```bash
behave -t @browser
behave -t @api
```

---

## Credentials & Config

Sensitive data like DB credentials, API keys, and URLs are managed via:

- `properties.ini`
- `configurations.py`

Make sure these are updated before running tests.

---

## Notable Features

-  Page Object Model for test stability
-  Handles stale elements & dynamic waits
-  Clean test-data teardown (cart cleanup logic)
-  Assertion messages for clear failures
-  Tests cover:
  - Product search & filtering
  - Add to cart & quantity updates
  - Price validation
  - Login (positive/negative cases)
  - API payload building from DB
  - Full BDD integration
